      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Jorge Lorenzo sits in the Yamaha hospitality unit at Sepang, flexing his right hand. It's 2017...</p>
        <blockquote>“The bike is faster than anything I've ridden, but faster doesn't mean rideable. Sometimes I feel like I'm fighting physics itself.”</blockquote>
        <p>Six years later... modern prototype racing.</p>

      <section id="arms-race">
        <h2>The Accidental Arms Race</h2>
        <p>To understand how we arrived at this point, you must trace the path...</p>
        <blockquote>“We never intended to build unrideable motorcycles...”<br/><small>— Gigi Dall'Igna, Ducati General Manager</small></blockquote>

      <section id="physiology">
        <h2>The Physiological Ceiling</h2>
        <p>Cal Crutchlow discovered this ceiling during his first Honda test in 2014...</p>
        <blockquote>“We're seeing physiological adaptations...”<br/><small>— Dr. Michele Zasa</small></blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="transition-failure">
        <h2>The Transition Failure Rate</h2>
        <p>Moto2 provides the clearest evidence of this growing gap...</p>
        <blockquote>“The performance delta has become unbridgeable...”<br/><small>— Marco Melandri</small></blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="neural">
        <h2>The Neural Bottleneck</h2>
        <p>Recent neuroscience research reveals why the transition has become impossible...</p>
        <blockquote>“MotoGP riders process visual information 40% faster...”<br/><small>— Dr. Alan Wing</small></blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="electronics">
        <h2>The Electronic Paradox</h2>
        <p>Modern MotoGP electronics, rather than making bikes easier to ride, have created new layers of complexity...</p>
        <blockquote>“The electronics don't compensate for rider limitations—they amplify them.”<br/><small>— Gigi Dall'Igna</small></blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="temperature">
        <h2>The Temperature Trap</h2>
        <p>Perhaps nowhere is the amateur exclusion more complete than tire management...</p>
        <blockquote>“You must brake harder, corner faster, and accelerate more aggressively than feels safe.”<br/><small>— Nicolas Goubert</small></blockquote>

      <section id="aero">
        <h2>The Aerodynamic Burden</h2>
        <p>Modern MotoGP aerodynamics represent the final barrier to amateur access...</p>
        <blockquote>“It's like doing a 45-minute plank while operating a precision instrument.”<br/><small>— Jorge Martin</small></blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="selection">
        <h2>The Selection Process</h2>
        <p>Today's MotoGP grid represents the culmination of the most rigorous selection process in motorsport...</p>
        <blockquote>“We're not selecting the best motorcycle riders anymore...”<br/><small>— Kevin Schwantz</small></blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="future">
        <h2>The Future Trajectory</h2>
        <p>Current development trends suggest the biological gap will continue widening...</p>
        <blockquote>“We're approaching a point where the machines might exceed what any human can manage.”<br/><small>— Gigi Dall'Igna</small></blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="boundary">
        <h2>The Biological Boundary</h2>
        <p>Standing in the Ducati garage at Misano... This isn't about courage or determination. It's about compatibility between machine evolution and human biology.</p>
        <p>The machine will not accommodate their limitations because it was never designed to...</p>
